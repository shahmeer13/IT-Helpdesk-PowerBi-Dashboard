# IT-Helpdesk-PowerBi-Dashboard

This project showcases my ability to turn raw IT support data into meaningful insights using real industry tools.  
I built an interactive **IT Help Desk Performance Dashboard** using **Excel, Power BI, DAX, and SQL concepts**, simulating a realistic corporate helpdesk environment. The dashboard tracks ticket workload, resolution efficiency, priority handling, and technician performance — the same type of reporting IT teams rely on to improve operations and service delivery.

The goal of this project was not just to visualize data, but to design something practical, understandable, and useful from a business perspective. It demonstrates my ability to work with structured datasets, build clean dashboards, apply analytical thinking, and present results in a professional format suitable for hiring managers and technical teams.
